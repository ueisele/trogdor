== Unit Tests

Where are the unit tests?
* The unit tests are located under the `test` directory.

How do I run the unit tests?
* python setup.py test

How can I add a unit test?
* Follow the naming conventions - module name starts with "check", class name begins with "Check", test method name begins with "check"
* These naming conventions are defined in "setup.cfg". We use "check" to distinguish unit tests from system tests, which use "test" in the various names.
